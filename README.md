# Lexical analysis

Lexical tokenization is conversion of a text into meaningful lexical tokens belonging to categories defined by a "lexer" program.

what does it parse?

- Modern Syntax
- Static Types
- Implicit & Emplicit Type Ineterface
- Array and String Literals
- Control flow and Imports


# Tokenization
- Tokenization is the process in which you transform a stream of characters into meaningful array of tokens


# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
An AST is a data structure which represents the program's structure. AST's are easy to traverse and have many uses.

      +
    /   \
   2     *
        / \
       3   4


# Producing an AST
We will construct the AST by processing the tokens we received from the lexer.
This process of building AST from tokens is called ==Parsing==.
